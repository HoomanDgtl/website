It’s now easier than ever to deploy on the Akash Supercloud. [Akash Console](https://console.akash.network/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=organic_blog&utm_campaign=cc_payment_launch) now accepts credit cards to pay for compute resources on the network. This is a significant step in making permissionless cloud compute accessible to everyone. Until now, using Akash was accessible only with AKT or USDC, requiring a non-custodial wallet for storing and transacting on-chain. While crypto-native users are comfortable with this system, many developers and teams need more familiar payment options. Starting today, users can easily pay for Akash deployments with a credit card.

## Making Permissionless Compute Simple
The new payment system is built right into Akash Console with a Stripe integration. Users can instantly add funds to their accounts, manage active deployments, and monitor spending — all through a familiar console interface. This allows users to choose what works best: credit card payments or managing funds with a non-custodial wallet. Whether it's an enterprise that needs standard payment methods for compliance, a developer just starting with permissionless compute, or a team moving to decentralized infrastructure — Akash Console now supports their preferred payment method.

## Bringing the Akash Supercloud to Everyone
Adding credit card payments is about more than convenience. It's about making decentralized cloud compute practical for mainstream adoption. By combining the permissionless nature of blockchain with familiar payment tools, Akash is creating a cloud platform that brings compute to market in a truly decentralized manner, with easy-to-use applications that work for everyone. This development breaks down yet another barrier between traditional and permissionless infrastructure, marking a crucial step toward widespread adoption.

As part of the new payment system, new Akash Console users can now explore the Supercloud’s capabilities without the need to add any payment method with a new Free Trial tier. The Free Trial provides $10 in credit to deploy an application and test the full capabilities of the network. This hands-on experience lets developers validate Akash's performance and cost advantages before committing to adding funds to their accounts. Then, once users are ready to add funds to their deployment, simply pay by credit card, and the additional funds will be available immediately in the account balance.
